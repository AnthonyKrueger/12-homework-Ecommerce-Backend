# E-commerce_Backend


  ## Description
  
  An express application that allows the user to view and edit a MySQL database of products, categories, and tags. The application uses CRUD operations to allow the user to create an in-depth database to keep track of products in different ways. A single category and many tags can be assigned to each product. Products, Tags, and Categories can all be created, updated, viewed, and deleted using the application. Products can have a single category assigned to them, and any amount of tags.

  ## Installation
  
  To install all necessary dependencies, navigate to the application directory and run 
  
  ```npm i```
  
  A MySQL database named 'ecommerce_db' will be required to run the application. Once the database is created, you must link the application by creating a .env file with the following format
  
```
DB_USER=[username]
DB_PW=[password]
DB_NAME=ecommerce_db
```
  
  Once that is complete, the application is ready to run!
  


  ## Usage
  
  Start the application by navigating to the directory and running 
  
  ```node server.js```
  
   From there, you can use an application like Insomnia Core or Postman to make GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests to your server using /api routes.
